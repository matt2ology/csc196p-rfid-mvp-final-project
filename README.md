# CSC 196P - Final Project MVP - Cloud Solution: RFID Technology & Raspberry Pi as a Platform

Final project for CSC 196P, Cloud and Mobile Computing Pragmatics, where a
minimum viable product (mvp) using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
scanner + tags and Raspberry Pi. This project must leverage the cloud.

## Project Proposal

My project will use the Raspberry Pi as the platform and connects to Firebase.
The "service" will allow users to scan their RFID tags to indicate a "check-in"
and allow administrators to "enroll" users to their respective RFID tags via a
web/app portal customers (i.e. users and admin account holders) will use SSO to
log in. Restful APIs are used to interface with database to log "check-ins" and
"enroll" new users to RFID tags. SMS alerts will verify to users that their
RFID tag(s) has been assigned to them, has been used to "check-in", or notify
if it has been returned to lost-and-found.

## Python Dependencies

- **firebase_admin:** is the Firebase Admin SDK for Python. It enables access
  to Firebase services from privileged environments in Python. The SDK provides
  a way to interact with Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database,
  Firebase Authentication, Google Cloud Storage, and Firebase Cloud Messaging.
  - `pip install firebase_admin`
- **mfrc522:** is an implementation of the RFID RC522 interface, this library
  handles all the heavy lifting for talking with the RFID over the Piâ€™s SPI
  Interface and is used to read the RFID tags.
- **twilio:** is a Python module that allows you to interact with the Twilio
  API. With it, you can send SMS messages, make phone calls, and send emails.
- **python-escpos:** is a Python library that allows you to send data to
  thermal printers. It is a pure Python implementation that works with Python
  2.7 and Python 3.4+.
  - `python -m pip install python-escpos`
- **adafruit-circuitpython-thermal-printer:** is a CircuitPython library for
  thermal printers. It is designed to work with the Adafruit Mini Thermal
  Receipt Printer. It should work with any printer that uses ESC/POS commands
  like the Epson TM-T20 or the [Maikrt Micro Thermal Printer](https://a.co/d/7SnoBkb),
  but has only been tested with the Adafruit printer.
  - `pip install adafruit-circuitpython-thermal-printer`

## Raspberry Pi Setup & Configuration for Thermal Printer (Maikrt)

### Test via USB

`lsusb` - list USB devices: a utility for displaying information about USB
buses in the system and the devices connected to them. It uses udev's hardware
database to associate a full human-readable name to the vendor ID and the
product ID.

[USB printers may present themselves to the system differently depending which USB-to-serial chip they use internally. Try the following first:](https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi/connect-and-configure-printer#:~:text=USB%20printers%20may%20present%20themselves%20to%20the%20system%20differently%20depending%20which%20USB%2Dto%2Dserial%20chip%20they%20use%20internally.%20Try%20the%20following%20first%3A)

```bash
ls -l /dev/usb/lp0
```

Print a test page:

```bash
echo -e "This is a test.\\n\\n\\n" > /dev/usb/lp0
```

Print a test image:

```bash
lp -o fit-to-page /usr/share/raspberrypi-artwork/raspberry-pi-logo.png
```

### Test viaTransistor-Transistor Logic (TTL)

[For a TTL (not USB) printer, type the following (substitute the correct baud rate for your printer):](<https://learn.adafruit.com/networked-thermal-printer-using-cups-and-raspberry-pi/connect-and-configure-printer#:~:text=For%20a%20TTL%20(not%20USB)%20printer%2C%20type%20the%20following%20(substitute%20the%20correct%20baud%20rate%20for%20your%20printer)%3A>)

```bash
stty -F /dev/serial0 9600
echo -e "This is a test.\\n\\n\\n" > /dev/serial0
```
